I think I just got influenced. 



Whether or not tiktok is actually spying on me, I do appreciate the swiftness with which its algorithm learned that I had picked up knitting. It started with a few clips of people sharing knitting inside jokes (counting stitches, running out of yarn, misreading a pattern) and trickled into a whole feed of people sharing astonishing works of hand knitted art. I was particularly captivated by a clip[^1] of a woman sharing her journey into knitting by jumping from finishing a scarf right into making a sweater, following a really interesting Fair Isle pattern with beautiful sky blue merino wool yarn. 

[^1]: I searched high and low through my TikTok trying to find this video to no avail. 


But one pattern in particular (as I would later realize, trends exist in the knit pattern world too) was ubiquitous: the [Sophie scarf](https://www.petiteknit.com/en/collections/halstorklaeder/products/sophie-scarf). The original Sophie scarf (original because there exists many copy cats at this point) was designed by Mette Wendelboe Okkels of PetiteKnit in Denmark. And while it's labeled a scarf, I would describe it more like a neck tie or folded bandana since it's quite thin and tapers towards the ends. Construction wise, it's quite simple, consisting of just knitting in rows to make a garter stitch, with the edges reinforced by an *i*-cord and a length that is controlled by the frequency of the increases/decreases on either half. 


With a relatively simple design that can accomodate basically any yarn (and a pattern that is available in 16 languages), it's no surprise I saw it everywhere. And though I am typically not one to be moved by what's trendy or stylish or popular, I loved this scarf. What's more, there's a hood version, which I could see myself wearing easily in this Minnesota winter. So yeah, I was influenced.

When I finished up the Christmas Frenzy, my plan was to get Cole's socks going. During the shopping trip to the [Yarnery](https://yarnery.com/) for that project, I finally gave in to the beauty of the artisen yarn and bought myself a hank of incredible Peruvian-made Merino wool yarn, hand-dyed a gorgeous mixture of dark blue, teal, and green. In the shop, I didn't have any plans for it, but the yarn was screaming to be used for something besides a hat or mittens. So I landed on the Sophie hood. 

## Project Info
> Pattern: [Sophie Hood by PetiteKnit](https://www.petiteknit.com/en/collections/halstorklaeder/products/sophie-hood)

> Yarn: [Arroyo Merino wool by Malabrigo](https://yarnery.com/collections/yarn/products/arroyo?variant=43262333780119), wabi-sabi colorway, 100% Merino wool, DK weight

> Needles: US 8

> Misc: quality


The aim is to get started on this project after finishing Cole's socks. Having learned my lesson with that project (hanks != skeins), there'll be some prep work I can get done in the meantime. 

The original Sophie scarf yarn is a vibrant red color but I think the simplicity of the knitted pattern is a great place for the color variation of the Arroyo yarn to shine. Plus, I want to treat this yarn right -- besides the wool socks, every other project has been a learning experience where decent is good enough and good enough is all I asked. But here I want to challenge myself in the name of quality. I take inspiration from Mette herself:

> "A part of my motivation for knitting for myself has always been to knit something of just as high or higher quality than I could have bought. Both in the quality of the yarn I use and in the way the knitwear fits me [...] because the process is as much a part of the pleasure as the finished knitwear, it is okay to work on it for many hours rather than rush it and not be satisfied with the result," - Mette Wendelboe Okkels, PetiteKnit.
