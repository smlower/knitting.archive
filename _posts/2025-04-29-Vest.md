sweater - sleeves = vest. I can do a vest. 


First, it would be difficult to argue that knitting is primarily a cold weather activity. Or, more accurately, knitwear is winter weather wear. Hats, gloves, scarves, socks, sweaters...all lend themselves to comfy cold weather apparel in soft woolens and acrylics. So am I just supposed to quit knitting now that it's getting warmer? NO. 

Second, the ultimate " I've made it " goal I set for myself at the start of this journey was to knit myself a sweater. And while I feel like that is still on the horizon, I think a good warm up round (one of many) is this [vest](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/vacation-vest) I happened upon while scrolling through TikTok (knit-Tok?). The construction is less sweater vest or suit vest and more drapey, airy warm weather tie tank. Think this linen [piece from Target](https://www.target.com/p/women-s-linen-tie-v-neck-blouse-a-new-day/-/A-93341549?preselect=93194846#lnk=sametab). The Vacation Vest appears to be quite versatile, with finished pieces done in cotton, linen, and acrylic with an option to tie the front together or leave it open. 

My thinking with this piece is that 1) it'll be a good piece to learn sizing on and 2) my first non-accessory wearable that will be a challenge without having to get into sleeves, etc. Based on some perusing of several knitting blogs, popular summertime fibers to knit with are cotton, linen/silk blends, and Merino wool. Each fiber will impart a different vibe onto the piece (cotton holds its shape, wool drapes, linen is kind of in the middle but has a rougher texture). I think I want to give linen blend yarn a go (I'm very much on a linen clothing kick as of late) and I think it'll be a nice, airy fiber to work with. 

Here's to diving into summer with my first big project. I'll check back in when it's underway.
