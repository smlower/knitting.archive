A hat in Technicolor


So there's knitting, purling, ribbing, stockinette, obviously cable (but I feel too faint-of-heart to try that), and plain ol garter stitch. And those let you create so many interesting patterns and shapes. But there's another axis to explore: color. Now, obviously you can make any project colorful by picking a yarn that changes color throughout or something like tweed with little flecks of color in it. But to make a *pattern* you need to use color strategically. Think Fair Isle and the Norwegian Setesdal patterns. Instead of detailed stitch work, these rely on colorwork to create designs. 


As my first project to flex my newborn knitting skills was a hat, I figured a hat should be the way to first explore colorwork too. Also in the same spirit, I attempted to find the least complex colorwork pattern that I liked, something that would make use of the yarn I had on hand. I landed on this [pattern](https://www.yarnspirations.com/products/red-heart-favorite-knit-fair-isle-hat?_pos=20&_sid=2a8a69460&_ss=r) from Yarnspirations that had a Fair Isle-esque pattern using three colors (a base color and two secondary colors). 


A typical knit pattern without colorwork will usually have instructions for each segment of the piece. So here, it instructed to do 1x1 ribbing for the cuff and then the rest of the hat would be knit in the round to make stockinette. But now there's a second set of instructions for the colorwork, called a color chart. And it is literally a table outlining the colors used for each stitch, row-by-row.

Now one thing that really puzzled me before using different yarns in the same project is how to switch between them; more specifically, what happens to the yarn that isn't being used? This is where another term comes in: floats. Essentially, the yarn that isn't being used is just spanned across the back of the other color's stitches when picked back up, which creates little parallel lines across the back of the piece- since they're not knitted into the work you need to be careful not to pull the yarn too tight when picking it back up or the tension will be off.

Now I read a few guides on how to manage these floats and learned there's ways to incorporate the floats into the piece so there's not as much loose yarn on the inside but I figured for this work, I'd just leave them like they appear in the above image. There's also a lot of discussion on how to hold the yarn since you're working from several strands at once - the majority seem to hold the two colors in different hands, basically doing English and Continental style knitting at the same time, but that also seemed to much for me to learn so I literally just dropped the strands that weren't needed so I only ever held one strand at a time. Inefficient, probably. But speed is not my goal. The floats probably also ended up looser than necessary but not so loose that they make the hat bulky. 

I'm pretty happy with the finished hat, but I had my sights set on another pattern.

When searching for an accessible colorwork hat pattern for my first try, I found this design, which I immediately fell in love with. It feels like a fun modern twist on the traditional Fair Isle patterns and lets me play with a bunch of different colors (part of why I didn't pick it first was the fact I didn't have enough complimentary colors to work with).

Looking at the chart, it's a bit more complicated than the first design, so I'll definitely need to pay attention to where I am in the pattern and which yarn is which since I'm not using the exact yarns from the pattern. I also opted to use just 3 contrasting colors instead of the 4 used in the pattern, because I plan to use the background color in place of the lighter yellow color. 

The plan is to finish the Sophie Hood first and then start on this - thankfully Minnesota winters are long so starting a hat in mid February will still let me get some good use out of it.
